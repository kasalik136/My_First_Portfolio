    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <h3>Learning HTML Basics</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>This is my very first webpage, created as part of my learning journey with HTML.</p>
    <p>Here, I am practicing how to structure a page with headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of the web, and learning it opens doors to web development.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m excited to keep building and learning more as I progress in my coding journey.</p>
